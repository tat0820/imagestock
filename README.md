# COVERSTOCK
COVERSTOCK is an app that can watch the collection of cd artworks that I chose.<br>
<br>
I've been collecting the pictures of music artworks that I really liked in my iphone.<br>
One day I thought that it would be amazing if there's an app that I can see all those pictures in one page,
and also can listen to the music of them.<br>
<br> 
This is a really simple app.<br>
Enjoy watching those artworks and if you're interested, click the picure.So the picture turns to youtube, and starts playing the music.
